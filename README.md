# Fractal Bench C# Multithreading

## Instructions

1. Build and Run the application from Visual Studio (Must be built for x86 instead of x64, this is due to us not noticing that the project was initially built for x86, the app should run the same either way since RAM is not a big requirement.).
2. Select amount of thread from drop down.
3. Click "Render", CPU usage chart will start showing, and the fractal will show when done rendering.
4. The fractal image will be exported to the download folder with the "FractalBench" name.
5. If you wish to rerun the benchmark, click the "Reset" to clear the graph and start from step 2.
